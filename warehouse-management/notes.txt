Authentication Implementation Investigation Notes

1. Current App Structure:
- Single App.tsx file with all components
- Uses useState for state management
- No routing system implemented
- Header with navigation in top area (ideal for logout button)

2. Available UI Components (shadcn/ui):
- Button (for logout button)
- Card, CardContent, CardHeader (for login form)
- Input (for username/password fields)
- Form (for login form validation)
- Dialog (could be used for logout confirmation)

3. Missing Dependencies:
- react-router-dom (needed for route protection and login page)
- No auth state management library (will use React Context)

4. Implementation Requirements:
- Add login page with admin/123456 credentials
- Add logout button in top-right corner
- Protect main app routes
- Persist auth state

5. Suggested Components Structure:
```tsx
- App.tsx (main layout + routing)
- components/
  - LoginPage.tsx (new)
  - AuthContext.tsx (new)
  - ProtectedRoute.tsx (new)
```

6. State Management Approach:
- Use React Context for auth state
- Store auth token in localStorage
- Implement protected route wrapper

7. UI/UX Considerations:
- Login form should be centered on page
- Logout button in header next to navigation
- Redirect to login page when unauthorized
- Show loading state during auth operations
